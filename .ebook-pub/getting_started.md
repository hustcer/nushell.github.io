# Getting Started

Let's get started! :elephant:

First, to be able to use Nushell, we need to [install it](installation.md).

The next sections will give you a [short tour of Nushell by example](quick_tour.md) (including how to get help from within Nushell), and show you how to [move around your file system](moving_around.md).

Finally, because Nushell takes some design decisions that are quite different from typical shells or dynamic scripting languages, make sure to check [Thinking in Nu](thinking_in_nu.md) that explains some of these concepts.
