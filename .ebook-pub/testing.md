# Testing your Nushell code

To ensure that your code works as expected, you can use the [testing module](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/blob/main/crates/nu-std/testing.nu).

## Quick start

Download the [testing module](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nushell/nushell/main/crates/nu-std/testing.nu) and save it as `testing.nu` in the folder with your project.

Have a file, called `test_math.nu`:

```nu
use std assert

#[test]
def test_addition [] {
    assert equal (1 + 2) 3
}

#[test]
#[ignore]
def test_skip [] {
    # this won't be run
}

#[test]
def test_failing [] {
    assert false "This is just for testing"
}
```

Run the tests:

```nu
❯ use testing.nu run-tests
❯ run-tests
INF|2023-04-12T10:42:29.099|Running tests in test_math
Error:

    ·            ──┬──
    ·              ╰── It is not true.
 15 │ }
    ╰────

  │
  │       test_math test_addition
  │     ⨯ test_math test_failing
  │     s test_math test_skip
  │
```

## Assert commands

The foundation for every assertion is the `std assert` command. If the condition is not true, it makes an error. For example:

```nu
❯ use std assert
❯ std assert (1 == 2)
Error:
  × Assertion failed.
   ╭─[entry #13:1:1]
 1 │ std assert (1 == 2)
   ·             ───┬──
   ·                ╰── It is not true.
   ╰────
```

Optionally, a message can be set to show the intention of the assert command, what went wrong or what was expected:

```nu
❯ std assert ($a == 19) $"The lockout code is wrong, received: ($a)"
Error:
  × The lockout code is wrong, received: 13
   ╭─[entry #25:1:1]
 1 │ std assert ($a == 19) $"The lockout code is wrong, received: ($a)"
   ·             ────┬───
   ·                 ╰── It is not true.
   ╰────
```

There are many assert commands, which behave exactly as the base one with the proper operator. The additional value for them is the ability for better error messages.

For example this is not so helpful without additional message:

```nu
❯ std assert ($b | str contains $a)
Error:
  × Assertion failed.
   ╭─[entry #35:1:1]
 1 │ assert ($b | str contains $a)
   ·              ──────┬─────
   ·                    ╰── It is not true.
   ╰────
```

While with using `assert str contains`:

```nu
❯ std assert str contains $b $a
Error:
  × Assertion failed.
   ╭─[entry #34:1:1]
 1 │ assert str contains $b $a
   ·                     ──┬──
   ·                       ╰── 'haystack' does not contain 'a needle'.
   ╰────
```

In general for base `assert` command it is encouraged to always provide the additional message to show what went wrong. If you cannot use any built-in assert command, you can create a custom one with passing the label for [`error make`](/commands/docs/error_make.md) for the `assert` command:

```nu
def "assert even" [number: int] {
    std assert ($number mod 2 == 0) --error-label {
        start: (metadata $number).span.start,
        end: (metadata $number).span.end,
        text: $"($number) is not an even number",
    }
}
```

Then you'll have your detailed custom error message:

```nu
❯ let $a = 13
❯ assert even $a
Error:
  × Assertion failed.
   ╭─[entry #37:1:1]
 1 │ assert even $a
   ·             ─┬
   ·              ╰── 13 is not an even number
   ╰────
```

## Test modules & test cases

The naming convention for test modules is `test_<your_module>.nu` and `test_<test name>` for test cases.

In order for a function to be recognized as a test by the test runner it needs to be annotated with `#[test]`.

The following annotations are supported by the test runner:

- test - test case to be executed during test run
- test-skip - test case to be skipped during test run
- before-all - function to run at the beginning of test run. Returns a global context record that is piped into every test function
- before-each - function to run before every test case. Returns a per-test context record that is merged with global context and piped into test functions
- after-each - function to run after every test case. Receives the context record just like the test cases
- after-all - function to run after all test cases have been executed. Receives the global context record

The standard library itself is tested with this framework, so you can find many examples in the [Nushell repository](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/blob/main/crates/nu-std/tests/).

## Setting verbosity

The `testing.nu` module uses the `log` commands from the standard library to display information, so you can set `NU_LOG_LEVEL` if you want more or less details:

```nu
❯ use testing.nu run-tests
❯ NU_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG run-tests
❯ NU_LOG_LEVEL=WARNING run-tests
```
