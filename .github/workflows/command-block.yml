            Awesome that you are trying to improve the documentation of a nushell command!

            As we autogenerate these command pages from the help information defined with the command after each release:
            - If you already updated the command help, you are already done!
            - Else, please look for the command in the [source tree](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/tree/main/crates) and make your changes directly there.

            Thanks for helping out!
